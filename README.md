This is the first forum software I have ever worked on, so here we go.

Welcome AcmlmBlarg. Blargboard, but Acmlmified.

So what is AcmlmBlarg?
It is a forum software based off of Blargboard and WWXD, with a AcmlmBoard feel. It will have many features ported from ABXD 3 and AB2.064.

Where are the screenshots so far?
I can't get the board up and running since the installation is running with errors, but you can help the ABL Team.
